<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Kanban Board][ <img src="" alt="Logo" width="80" height="80">]](https://example.com)

A kanban board is a visual way to manage tasks and workflows, Kanban—which is the Japanese word for “billboard”—was developed by Toyota in the 1940s. It was originally a scheduling system to execute just-in-time manufacturing. Tracking our activities on a daily basis is one  of the most eficient way to reach sucess on a project seeing and  parsing  how it grows.   

Here's why:

* A kanban board  is a good activities tracker ,I'm currently using this project as my initial homepage in order to keep my activities in line.
