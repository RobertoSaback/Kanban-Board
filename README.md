<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Kanban Board][ <img src="" alt="Logo" width="80" height="80">]](https://example.com)

   The core idea about this project , at  the very first begining , was understand better how drag and drop api works . Nevertheless throughout the time i was studying about it and other questions came  out, as well as: "How can i storage all the information and keep it there when i open the browser again ? "  and  that leads me to create new  features for this project and make something better than the original idea. 
   

Here's why:

* A kanban board  is a good activities tracker , use this as my initial page helps me to keep my activities in line.



### Built With
